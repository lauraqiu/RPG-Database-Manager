## Project Summary

For this project, we are proposing a user database for an MMORPG (massive multiplayer online role-playing game) similar in scale and scope to well-known titles like “World of Warcraft” and “Final Fantasy Online.” In theory, this database would be responsible for the player data of 10,000,000+ player accounts, as well as the inventory status and ranking of any characters created under a player account.

We are using an end-to-end approach such that every member is responsible for both the front and back ends of their assigned pages.

## Challenges

One challenge we face is the limited timeframe for completing the project, requiring us to allocate additional time for both development and learning new technologies. To tackle this, we will adhere closely to our timeline, schedule regular team meetings, and proactively reach out to the TA for support if we encounter difficulties or fall behind.
